# Data Mining using Cluster-Analysis
This project applies Cluster Analysis to segment the data basis the proximitly among the data points.
It is a statistical method for processing data. It works by organizing items into groups or clusters,
on the basis of how closely associated they are.
To divide the data into groups, we use the K-Means menthod to evaluate the number of groups.
The model uses the "Elbow Technique"
Elbow technique is used to obtain the optimal number of clusters for a set of data points 
because it is an empirical method, simple and easy to implement.
By applying the k-means clustering algorithm, the elbow technique plots the explained variations 
through the number of clusters and picks the curve of elbow to get the number of clusters. 
Using pandas, sklearn, numpy and matplotlib libraries Python libraries to run the analysis dividing
the dataset into groups basis the Age and Income factor.
